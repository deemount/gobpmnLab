# Structs

This Go code is part of a larger project that seems to be dealing with the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard. Here are some key observations:

1. Package and Imports: The code is part of the core package. It imports several other packages, most of which are from the same project (gobpmnLab), indicating a modular structure.

2. Structs: There are four main structs defined: DefinitionsBaseElements, TDefinitionsBaseElements, Definitions, and TDefinitions. These structs are likely used to represent different elements of a BPMN model.

3. XML and JSON Tags: Each field in the structs has XML and JSON tags. This suggests that the structs are used for both XML and JSON serialization/deserialization, likely to parse BPMN files (XML) and possibly to interact with APIs (JSON).

4. Embedding: The Definitions and TDefinitions structs embed DefinitionsBaseElements and TDefinitionsBaseElements respectively. This is a common Go idiom to achieve something similar to inheritance in object-oriented languages.

5. Namespaces: The Definitions struct contains many fields related to XML namespaces. This is typical in XML-based standards like BPMN, which use namespaces to avoid element name conflicts.

6. Optional Fields: Many fields are marked with omitempty in their XML and JSON tags, indicating that these fields are optional and should not be included in the serialized output if they are empty.

7. Collaboration with Other Packages: The code collaborates with other packages such as canvas, collaboration, events, marker, and process. This suggests a separation of concerns, where each package handles a different aspect of the BPMN standard.
