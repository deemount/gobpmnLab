# Definitions

This Go code is part of a larger project that seems to be related to the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). Here are some key observations:

1. Package and Imports: The code is part of the core package. It imports several other packages, including standard Go packages like fmt and log, as well as other packages from the same project (e.g., canvas, collaboration, events, impl, marker, process, utils).

2. Global Variables: The code defines a set of global string variables, which appear to be URLs for various BPMN and XML schemas.

3. Struct and Methods: The main struct in this file is Definitions. It has a number of methods associated with it, which can be categorized into:
* Setters: These methods set various attributes of a Definitions object. Some of them set specific schema URLs, while others generate and set IDs or create new slices for different elements.
* Getters: These methods return pointers to specific attributes or elements of a Definitions object.
* Default Setters: These methods set default values for some attributes and elements of a Definitions object.
* String Methods: These methods return a string representation of a Definitions object.
* Schema Fetcher: This method fetches the Camunda schema using a utility function.

1. Utility Functions: The code uses a utility function GenerateHash to generate a hash value, which is used as part of the ID for a Definitions object.
